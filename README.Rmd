# BayesMaxEnt

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

BayesMaxEnt is an attempt to implement a Bayesian version of MaxEnt models of species distributions. It uses MCMC via the `nimble` package, along with code and ideas from `maxnet`.

At the moment the vignette isn't rendering fully, but copying and pasting the code should work.

## Installation

You can install the development version of BayesMaxEnt from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("oharar/BayesMaxEnt")
```

## Example

This would be a basic example but it is better to check the vignette.

```{r example}
library(BayesMaxEnt)
## basic example code
```
